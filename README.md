# Market Reconstruction

## About

This is the repository for the code I wrote to perform a market reconstruction through a Markov process. Data source is [Yahoo! Finance][1].

The purpose of such code is to study the structure within financial markets and is part of my master's thesis entitled _Modeling Stock Markets through the Reconstruction of Market Processes_.

Supervisor: Tanya Ara√∫jo

Program: Master in Economics

Institution: ISEG (Lisbon School of Economics & Management), Universidade de Lisboa

The code is written in MATLAB and is publicly available for scrutiny, improvement or forks under the relevant license (MIT).

All functions were written to be as general as possible and [random.org][2]'s API was incorporated to use real random numbers when available. If not possible, then MATLAB's pseudo-number generator is used instead.

For detailed information about the functions and scripts, please refer to the [Wiki documentation][3].
